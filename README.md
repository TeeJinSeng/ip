Parts of this project were developed with assistance from OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-5), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash and Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5.
The AI was used for code explanations, documentation drafting, and brainstorming possible designs. It was also used to generate exception messages that sounds more natural. All code was reviewed, tested, and finalized by the project authors.
